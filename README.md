# Otter_USV_Path_Following

This project consist my master thesis research about path following of Otter surface vehicle that is developed by maritime robotic AS. In this study, the trajectory generated using kinodynamic RRT will be tracked using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) with the assistance of the Line of Sight (LOS) algorithm. In autonomous systems, the vehicle's route planning and trajectory tracking systems are controlled by the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) architecture. The block diagram of this structure is depicted in the image below.
